  <h1>Lorem ipsum</h1>  <!-- red -->
  <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>  <!-- blue -->
  Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.  <!-- noting -->
  <p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
  when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
  It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
  remaining essentially unchanged.</p>  <!-- blue -->
  <p>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
  and more recently with desktop publishing software 
  like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
